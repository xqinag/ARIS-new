# Research Review via External Reviewer Backend (xhigh reasoning)

> 🔒 **Do not wrap this skill in `/loop`, `/schedule`, or `CronCreate`.** It is
> verdict-bearing — it produces a cross-model review verdict, multi-round with
> reviewer thread continuity. An external timer re-fires the verdict on
> wall-clock time and breaks the reviewer's round-to-round memory: zero new
> signal, full token cost. Schedule the *external wait that precedes it* (work
> ready → then review once), not the verdict. See
> [`shared-references/external-cadence.md`](../shared-references/external-cadence.md).

Get a multi-round critical review of research work from the selected external reviewer backend with maximum reasoning depth.

## Constants

- REVIEWER_MODEL = `gpt-5.5` — Default model for the Codex backend. Must be an OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-5.5`, `o3`, `gpt-4o`). Manual backend uses whatever model the user chooses.
- **REVIEWER_BACKEND = `codex`** — Default: Codex MCP (xhigh). Override with `— reviewer: oracle-pro` for Oracle MCP, or `— reviewer: manual` for Manual Review MCP. If manual-review MCP is unavailable, stop and print the install command; do not fall back to Codex. See `shared-references/reviewer-routing.md`.

## Reviewer Calling Convention

When calling the reviewer, branch on REVIEWER_BACKEND:

**If REVIEWER_BACKEND = `codex`:**
  Use `mcp__codex__codex` for new review threads.
  Use `mcp__codex__codex-reply` for follow-up rounds (reuse threadId).

**If REVIEWER_BACKEND = `manual`:**
  Use `mcp__manual_review__review` for new review threads with:
    prompt: [exact same prompt that would go to Codex]
    config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}
  Save the returned `threadId`.
  Use `mcp__manual_review__review_reply` for follow-up rounds with:
    threadId: [saved manual-review threadId]
    prompt: [follow-up prompt]
    config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}

Prompt fidelity: the manual prompt must be exactly the same text that Codex would receive.
Review tracing applies equally to both backends.

## Context: $ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

- **Codex MCP Server** configured in Claude Code:
  ```bash
  claude mcp add codex -s user -- codex mcp-server
  ```
- This gives Claude Code access to `mcp__codex__codex` and `mcp__codex__codex-reply` tools

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Research Context
Before calling the external reviewer, compile a comprehensive briefing:
1. Read project narrative documents (e.g., STORY.md, README.md, paper drafts)
2. Read any memory/notes files for key findings and experiment history
3. Identify: core claims, methodology, key results, known weaknesses

### Step 2: Initial Review (Round 1)
Send a detailed prompt with xhigh reasoning, using the selected backend.

*For codex backend:*

```
mcp__codex__codex:
  config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}
  prompt: |
    [Full research context + specific questions]
    Please act as a senior ML reviewer (NeurIPS/ICML level). Identify:
    1. Logical gaps or unjustified claims
    2. Missing experiments that would strengthen the story
    3. Narrative weaknesses
    4. Whether the contribution is sufficient for a top venue
    Please be brutally honest.
```

*For manual backend:* use `mcp__manual_review__review` with the same prompt and `config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}`. Save the returned `threadId`.

### Step 3: Iterative Dialogue (Rounds 2-N)
For `codex` backend: use `mcp__codex__codex-reply` with the returned `threadId`.
For `manual` backend: use `mcp__manual_review__review_reply` with the same `threadId`.
Use the appropriate tool to continue the conversation:

For each round:
1. **Respond** to criticisms with evidence/counterarguments
2. **Ask targeted follow-ups** on the most actionable points
3. **Request specific deliverables**: experiment designs, paper outlines, claims matrices

Key follow-up patterns:
- "If we reframe X as Y, does that change your assessment?"
- "What's the minimum experiment to satisfy concern Z?"
- "Please design the minimal additional experiment package (highest acceptance lift per GPU week)"
- "Please write a mock NeurIPS/ICML review with scores"
- "Give me a results-to-claims matrix for possible experimental outcomes"

### Step 4: Convergence
Stop iterating when:
- Both sides agree on the core claims and their evidence requirements
- A concrete experiment plan is established
- The narrative structure is settled

### Step 5: Document Everything
Save the full interaction and conclusions to a review document in the project root:
- Round-by-round summary of criticisms and responses
- Final consensus on claims, narrative, and experiments
- Claims matrix (what claims are allowed under each possible outcome)
- Prioritized TODO list with estimated compute costs
- Paper outline if discussed

Update project memory/notes with key review conclusions.

> **Composed mode** — if invoked with `— composed: <canonical-report-path>` (an
> orchestrator like `/idea-discovery` passes this), do **not** write a standalone review
> `.md` in the project root. The raw conversation is already persisted to `.aris/traces/…`
> (see *Review Tracing* below — that audit copy is kept in every mode); fold the review
> *conclusions* (consensus, claims matrix, prioritized TODOs) into the orchestrator's
> canonical report and cite the trace path there. **Default (no `— composed:` directive):
> behave exactly as above — write the standalone review document.** Never infer composed
> mode from a report file merely existing. Full rules:
> [`shared-references/output-composition.md`](../shared-references/output-composition.md).

## Key Rules

- ALWAYS use `config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}` for reviews
- Send comprehensive context in Round 1 — the external model cannot read your files
- Be honest about weaknesses — hiding them leads to worse feedback
- Push back on criticisms you disagree with, but accept valid ones
- Focus on ACTIONABLE feedback — "what experiment would fix this?"
- Document the threadId for potential future resumption
- The review document should be self-contained (readable without the conversation)

## Prompt Templates

### For initial review:
"I'm going to present a complete ML research project for your critical review. Please act as a senior ML reviewer (NeurIPS/ICML level)..."

### For experiment design:
"Please design the minimal additional experiment package that gives the highest acceptance lift per GPU week. Our compute: [describe]. Be very specific about configurations."

### For paper structure:
"Please turn this into a concrete paper outline with section-by-section claims and figure plan."

### For claims matrix:
"Please give me a results-to-claims matrix: what claim is allowed under each possible outcome of experiments X and Y?"

### For mock review:
"Please write a mock NeurIPS review with: Summary, Strengths, Weaknesses, Questions for Authors, Score, Confidence, and What Would Move Toward Accept."

## Review Tracing

After each reviewer call (`mcp__codex__codex`, `mcp__codex__codex-reply`, `mcp__manual_review__review`, or `mcp__manual_review__review_reply`), save the trace following `shared-references/review-tracing.md` (Policy C — forensic; never silently skip). Use `save_trace.sh` (resolved per the chain in `shared-references/integration-contract.md` §2) or write files directly to `.aris/traces/<skill>/<date>_run<NN>/`. Respect the `--- trace:` parameter (default: `full`).
